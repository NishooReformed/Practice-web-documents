            <div>It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life. I have, as it were, a
                superstitious hesitation in lifting the veil that clings about my childhood like a golden mist.
                The task of writing an autobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest
                impressions, I find that fact and fancy look alike across the years that link the past with the
                present. The woman paints the child's experiences in her own fantasy. A few impressions
                stand out vividly from the first years of my life; but "the shadows of the prisonhouse
                are on
                the rest." Besides, many of the joys and sorrows of childhood have lost their poignancy; and
                many incidents of vital importance in my early education have been forgotten in the
                excitement of great discoveries. In order, therefore, not to be tedious I shall try to present in a
                series of sketches only the episodes that seem to me to be the most interesting and important.
                I was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, a little town of northern Alabama.
                The family on my father's side is descended from Caspar Keller, a native of Switzerland,
                who settled in Maryland. One of my Swiss ancestors was the first teacher of the deaf in Zurich
                and wrote a book on the subject of their education—rather a singular coincidence; though it is
                true that there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has
                not had a king among his.
                My grandfather, Caspar Keller's son, "entered" large tracts of land in Alabama and finally
                settled there. I have been told that once a year he went from Tuscumbia to Philadelphia on
                horseback to purchase supplies for the plantation, and my aunt has in her possession many of
                the letters to his family, which give charming and vivid accounts of these trips.
                My Grandmother Keller was a daughter of one of Lafayette's aides, Alexander Moore, and
                granddaughter of Alexander Spotswood, an early Colonial Governor of Virginia. She was also
                second cousin to Robert E. Lee.
                My father, Arthur H. Keller, was a captain in the Confederate Army, and my mother, Kate
                Adams, was his second wife and many years younger. Her grandfather, Benjamin Adams,
                married Susanna E. Goodhue, and lived in Newbury, Massachusetts, for many years. Their
                son, Charles Adams, was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and moved to Helena,
                Arkansas. When the Civil War broke out, he fought on the side of the South and became a
                brigadiergeneral.
                He married Lucy Helen Everett, who belonged to the same family of
                Everetts as Edward Everett and Dr. Edward Everett Hale. After the war was over the family
                moved to Memphis, Tennessee.
                I lived, up to the time of the illness that deprived me of my sight and hearing, in a tiny
                house consisting of a large square room and a small one, in which the servant slept. It is a
                custom in the South to build a small house near the homestead as an annex to be used on
                occasion. Such a house my father built after the Civil War, and when he married my mother
                they went to live in it. It was completely covered with vines, climbing roses and
                honeysuckles. From the garden it looked like an arbour. The little porch was hidden from view
                by a screen of yellow roses and Southern smilax. It was the favourite haunt of hummingbirds
                and bees.
                The Keller homestead, where the family lived, was a few steps from our little rosebower.
                It
                was called "Ivy Green" because the house and the surrounding trees and fences were covered
                with beautiful English ivy. Its oldfashioned
                garden was the paradise of my childhood.
                Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square stiff boxwood
                hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell would find the first violets and lilies. There, too,
                after a fit of temper, I went to find comfort and to hide my hot face in the cool leaves and
                grass. What joy it was to lose myself in that garden of flowers, to wander happily from spot to
                spot, until, coming suddenly upon a beautiful vine, I recognized it by its leaves and blossoms,
                and knew it was the vine which covered the tumbledown
                summerhouse
                at the farther end of
                the garden! Here, also, were trailing clematis, drooping jessamine, and some rare sweet
                flowers called butterfly lilies, because their fragile petals resemble butterflies' wings. But the
                roses—they were loveliest of all. Never have I found in the greenhouses of the North such
                heartsatisfying
                roses as the climbing roses of my southern home. They used to hang in long
                festoons from our porch, filling the whole air with their fragrance, untainted by any earthy
                smell; and in the early morning, washed in the dew, they felt so soft, so pure, I could not help
                wondering if they did not resemble the asphodels of God's garden.
                The beginning of my life was simple and much like every other little life. I came, I saw, I
                conquered, as the first baby in the family always does. There was the usual amount of
                discussion as to a name for me. The first baby in the family was not to be lightly named, every
                one was emphatic about that. My father suggested the name of Mildred Campbell, an ancestor
                whom he highly esteemed, and he declined to take any further part in the discussion. My
                mother solved the problem by giving it as her wish that I should be called after her mother,
                whose maiden name was Helen Everett. But in the excitement of carrying me to church my
                father lost the name on the way, very naturally, since it was one in which he had declined to
                have a part. When the minister asked him for it, he just remembered that it had been decided
                to call me after my grandmother, and he gave her name as Helen Adams.
                I am told that while I was still in long dresses I showed many signs of an eager, selfasserting
                disposition. Everything that I saw other people do I insisted upon imitating. At six
                months I could pipe out "How d'ye," and one day I attracted every one's attention by saying
                "Tea, tea, tea" quite plainly. Even after my illness I remembered one of the words I had
                learned in these early months. It was the word "water," and I continued to make some sound
                for that word after all other speech was lost. I ceased making the sound "wahwah"
                only when
                I learned to spell the word.
                They tell me I walked the day I was a year old. My mother had just taken me out of the
                bathtub
                and was holding me in her lap, when I was suddenly attracted by the flickering
                shadows of leaves that danced in the sunlight on the smooth floor. I slipped from my mother's
                lap and almost ran toward them. The impulse gone, I fell down and cried for her to take me up
                in her arms.
                These happy days did not last long. One brief spring, musical with the song of robin and
                mockingbird,
                one summer rich in fruit and roses, one autumn of gold and crimson sped by
                and left their gifts at the feet of an eager, delighted child. Then, in the dreary month of
                February, came the illness which closed my eyes and ears and plunged me into the
                unconsciousness of a newborn
                baby. They called it acute congestion of the stomach and
                brain. The doctor thought I could not live. Early one morning, however, the fever left me as
                suddenly and mysteriously as it had come. There was great rejoicing in the family that
                morning, but no one, not even the doctor, knew that I should never see or hear again.
                I fancy I still have confused recollections of that illness. I especially remember the
                tenderness with which my mother tried to soothe me in my waling hours of fret and pain, and
                the agony and bewilderment with which I awoke after a tossing half sleep, and turned my
                eyes, so dry and hot, to the wall away from the onceloved
                light, which came to me dim and
                yet more dim each day. But, except for these fleeting memories, if, indeed, they be memories,
                it all seems very unreal, like a nightmare. Gradually I got used to the silence and darkness that
                surrounded me and forgot that it had ever been different, until she came—my teacher—who
                was to set my spirit free. But during the first nineteen months of my life I had caught glimpses
                of broad, green fields, a luminous sky, trees and flowers which the darkness that followed
                could not wholly blot out. If we have once seen, "the day is ours, and what the day has
                shown."</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 2</p>
            <div>I cannot recall what happened during the first months after my illness. I only know that I sat
                in my mother's lap or clung to her dress as she went about her household duties. My hands felt
                every object and observed every motion, and in this way I learned to know many things. Soon
                I felt the need of some communication with others and began to make crude signs. A shake of
                the head meant "No" and a nod, "Yes," a pull meant "Come" and a push, "Go." Was it bread
                that I wanted? Then I would imitate the acts of cutting the slices and buttering them. If I
                wanted my mother to make icecream
                for dinner I made the sign for working the freezer and
                shivered, indicating cold. My mother, moreover, succeeded in making me understand a good
                deal. I always knew when she wished me to bring her something, and I would run upstairs or
                anywhere else she indicated. Indeed, I owe to her loving wisdom all that was bright and good
                in my long night.
                I understood a good deal of what was going on about me. At five I learned to fold and put
                away the clean clothes when they were brought in from the laundry, and I distinguished my
                own from the rest. I knew by the way my mother and aunt dressed when they were going out,
                and I invariably begged to go with them. I was always sent for when there was company, and
                when the guests took their leave, I waved my hand to them, I think with a vague remembrance
                of the meaning of the gesture. One day some gentlemen called on my mother, and I felt the
                shutting of the front door and other sounds that indicated their arrival. On a sudden thought I
                ran upstairs before any one could stop me, to put on my idea of a company dress. Standing
                before the mirror, as I had seen others do, I anointed mine head with oil and covered my face
                thickly with powder. Then I pinned a veil over my head so that it covered my face and fell in
                folds down to my shoulders, and tied an enormous bustle round my small waist, so that it
                dangled behind, almost meeting the hem of my skirt. Thus attired I went down to help
                entertain the company.
                I do not remember when I first realized that I was different from other people; but I knew it
                before my teacher came to me. I had noticed that my mother and my friends did not use signs
                as I did when they wanted anything done, but talked with their mouths. Sometimes I stood
                between two persons who were conversing and touched their lips. I could not understand, and
                was vexed. I moved my lips and gesticulated frantically without result. This made me so
                angry at times that I kicked and screamed until I was exhausted.
                I think I knew when I was naughty, for I knew that it hurt Ella, my nurse, to kick her, and
                when my fit of temper was over I had a feeling akin to regret. But I cannot remember any
                instance in which this feeling prevented me from repeating the naughtiness when I failed to
                get what I wanted.
                In those days a little coloured girl, Martha Washington, the child of our cook, and Belle, an
                old setter, and a great hunter in her day, were my constant companions. Martha Washington
                understood my signs, and I seldom had any difficulty in making her do just as I wished. It
                pleased me to domineer over her, and she generally submitted to my tyranny rather than risk a
                handtohand
                encounter. I was strong, active, indifferent to consequences. I knew my own
                mind well enough and always had my own way, even if I had to fight tooth and nail for it. We
                spent a great deal of time in the kitchen, kneading dough balls, helping make icecream,
                grinding coffee, quarreling over the cakebowl,
                and feeding the hens and turkeys that
                swarmed about the kitchen steps. Many of them were so tame that they would eat from my
                hand and let me feel them. One big gobbler snatched a tomato from me one day and ran away
                with it. Inspired, perhaps, by Master Gobbler's success, we carried off to the woodpile a cake
                which the cook had just frosted, and ate every bit of it. I was quite ill afterward, and I wonder
                if retribution also overtook the turkey.
                The guineafowl
                likes to hide her nest in outoftheway
                places, and it was one of my
                greatest delights to hunt for the eggs in the long grass. I could not tell Martha Washington
                when I wanted to go egghunting,
                but I would double my hands and put them on the ground,
                which meant something round in the grass, and Martha always understood. When we were
                fortunate enough to find a nest I never allowed her to carry the eggs home, making her
                understand by emphatic signs that she might fall and break them.
                The sheds where the corn was stored, the stable where the horses were kept, and the yard
                where the cows were milked morning and evening were unfailing sources of interest to
                Martha and me. The milkers would let me keep my hands on the cows while they milked, and
                I often got well switched by the cow for my curiosity.
                The making ready for Christmas was always a delight to me. Of course I did not know what
                it was all about, but I enjoyed the pleasant odours that filled the house and the tidbits that were
                given to Martha Washington and me to keep us quiet. We were sadly in the way, but that did
                not interfere with our pleasure in the least. They allowed us to grind the spices, pick over the
                raisins and lick the stirring spoons. I hung my stocking because the others did; I cannot
                remember, however, that the ceremony interested me especially, nor did my curiosity cause
                me to wake before daylight to look for my gifts.
                Martha Washington had as great a love of mischief as I. Two little children were seated on
                the veranda steps one hot July afternoon. One was black as ebony, with little bunches of fuzzy
                hair tied with shoestrings sticking out all over her head like corkscrews. The other was white,
                with long golden curls. One child was six years old, the other two or three years older. The
                younger child was blind—that was I—and the other was Martha Washington. We were busy
                cutting out paper dolls; but we soon wearied of this amusement, and after cutting up our
                shoestrings and clipping all the leaves off the honeysuckle that were within reach, I turned my
                attention to Martha's corkscrews. She objected at first, but finally submitted. Thinking that
                turn and turn about is fair play, she seized the scissors and cut off one of my curls, and would
                have cut them all off but for my mother's timely interference.
                Belle, our dog, my other companion, was old and lazy and liked to sleep by the open fire
                rather than to romp with me. I tried hard to teach her my sign language, but she was dull and
                inattentive. She sometimes started and quivered with excitement, then she became perfectly
                rigid, as dogs do when they point a bird. I did not then know why Belle acted in this way; but
                I knew she was not doing as I wished. This vexed me and the lesson always ended in a onesided
                boxing match. Belle would get up, stretch herself lazily, give one or two contemptuous
                sniffs, go to the opposite side of the hearth and lie down again, and I, wearied and
                disappointed, went off in search of Martha.
                Many incidents of those early years are fixed in my memory, isolated, but clear and distinct,
                making the sense of that silent, aimless, dayless life all the more intense.
                One day I happened to spill water on my apron, and I spread it out to dry before the fire
                which was flickering on the sittingroom
                hearth. The apron did not dry quickly enough to suit
                me, so I drew nearer and threw it right over the hot ashes. The fire leaped into life; the flames
                encircled me so that in a moment my clothes were blazing. I made a terrified noise that
                brought Viny, my old nurse, to the rescue. Throwing a blanket over me, she almost suffocated
                me, but she put out the fire. Except for my hands and hair I was not badly burned.
                About this time I found out the use of a key. One morning I locked my mother up in the
                pantry, where she was obliged to remain three hours, as the servants were in a detached part of
                the house. She kept pounding on the door, while I sat outside on the porch steps and laughed
                with glee as I felt the jar of the pounding. This most naughty prank of mine convinced my
                parents that I must be taught as soon as possible. After my teacher, Miss Sullivan, came to me,
                I sought an early opportunity to lock her in her room. I went upstairs with something which
                my mother made me understand I was to give to Miss Sullivan; but no sooner had I given it to
                her than I slammed the door to, locked it, and hid the key under the wardrobe in the hall. I
                could not be induced to tell where the key was. My father was obliged to get a ladder and take
                Miss Sullivan out through the window—much to my delight. Months after I produced the key.
                When I was about five years old we moved from the little vinecovered
                house to a large
                new one. The family consisted of my father and mother, two older halfbrothers,
                and,
                afterward, a little sister, Mildred. My earliest distinct recollection of my father is making my
                way through great drifts of newspapers to his side and finding him alone, holding a sheet of
                paper before his face. I was greatly puzzled to know what he was doing. I imitated this action,
                even wearing his spectacles, thinking they might help solve the mystery. But I did not find out
                the secret for several years. Then I learned what those papers were, and that my father edited
                one of them.
                My father was most loving and indulgent, devoted to his home, seldom leaving us, except
                in the hunting season. He was a great hunter, I have been told, and a celebrated shot. Next to
                his family he loved his dogs and gun. His hospitality was great, almost to a fault, and he
                seldom came home without bringing a guest. His special pride was the big garden where, it
                was said, he raised the finest watermelons and strawberries in the county; and to me he
                brought the first ripe grapes and the choicest berries. I remember his caressing touch as he led
                me from tree to tree, from vine to vine, and his eager delight in whatever pleased me.
                He was a famous storyteller;
                after I had acquired language he used to spell clumsily into
                my hand his cleverest anecdotes, and nothing pleased him more than to have me repeat them
                at an opportune moment.
                I was in the North, enjoying the last beautiful days of the summer of 1896, when I heard the
                news of my father's death. He had had a short illness, there had been a brief time of acute
                suffering, then all was over. This was my first great sorrow—my first personal experience
                with death.
                How shall I write of my mother? She is so near to me that it almost seems indelicate to
                speak of her.
                For a long time I regarded my little sister as an intruder. I knew that I had ceased to be my
                mother's only darling, and the thought filled me with jealousy. She sat in my mother's lap
                constantly, where I used to sit, and seemed to take up all her care and time. One day
                something happened which seemed to me to be adding insult to injury.
                At that time I had a muchpetted,
                muchabused
                doll, which I afterward named Nancy. She
                was, alas, the helpless victim of my outbursts of temper and of affection, so that she became
                much the worse for wear. I had dolls which talked, and cried, and opened and shut their eyes;
                yet I never loved one of them as I loved poor Nancy. She had a cradle, and I often spent an
                hour or more rocking her. I guarded both doll and cradle with the most jealous care; but once I
                discovered my little sister sleeping peacefully in the cradle. At this presumption on the part of
                one to whom as yet no tie of love bound me I grew angry. I rushed upon the cradle and overturned
                it, and the baby might have been killed had my mother not caught her as she fell. Thus
                it is that when we walk in the valley of twofold solitude we know little of the tender affections
                that grow out of endearing words and actions and companionship. But afterward, when I was
                restored to my human heritage, Mildred and I grew into each other's hearts, so that we were
                content to go handinhand
                wherever caprice led us, although she could not understand my
                finger language, nor I her childish prattle.</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 3</p>
            <div>Meanwhile the desire to express myself grew. The few signs I used became less and less
                adequate, and my failures to make myself understood were invariably followed by outbursts
                of passion. I felt as if invisible hands were holding me, and I made frantic efforts to free
                myself. I struggled—not that struggling helped matters, but the spirit of resistance was strong
                within me; I generally broke down in tears and physical exhaustion. If my mother happened to
                be near I crept into her arms, too miserable even to remember the cause of the tempest. After
                awhile the need of some means of communication became so urgent that these outbursts
                occurred daily, sometimes hourly.
                My parents were deeply grieved and perplexed. We lived a long way from any school for
                the blind or the deaf, and it seemed unlikely that any one would come to such an outoftheway
                place as Tuscumbia to teach a child who was both deaf and blind. Indeed, my friends and
                relatives sometimes doubted whether I could be taught. My mother's only ray of hope came
                from Dickens's "American Notes." She had read his account of Laura Bridgman, and
                remembered vaguely that she was deaf and blind, yet had been educated. But she also
                remembered with a hopeless pang that Dr. Howe, who had discovered the way to teach the
                deaf and blind, had been dead many years. His methods had probably died with him; and if
                they had not, how was a little girl in a faroff
                town in Alabama to receive the benefit of them?
                When I was about six years old, my father heard of an eminent oculist in Baltimore, who
                had been successful in many cases that had seemed hopeless. My parents at once determined
                to take me to Baltimore to see if anything could be done for my eyes.
                The journey, which I remember well was very pleasant. I made friends with many people
                on the train. One lady gave me a box of shells. My father made holes in these so that I could
                string them, and for a long time they kept me happy and contented. The conductor, too, was
                kind. Often when he went his rounds I clung to his coat tails while he collected and punched
                the tickets. His punch, with which he let me play, was a delightful toy. Curled up in a corner
                of the seat I amused myself for hours making funny little holes in bits of cardboard.
                My aunt made me a big doll out of towels. It was the most comical shapeless thing, this
                improvised doll, with no nose, mouth, ears or eyes—nothing that even the imagination of a
                child could convert into a face. Curiously enough, the absence of eyes struck me more than all
                the other defects put together. I pointed this out to everybody with provoking persistency, but
                no one seemed equal to the task of providing the doll with eyes. A bright idea, however, shot
                into my mind, and the problem was solved. I tumbled off the seat and searched under it until I
                found my aunt's cape, which was trimmed with large beads. I pulled two beads off and
                indicated to her that I wanted her to sew them on my doll. She raised my hand to her eyes in a
                questioning way, and I nodded energetically. The beads were sewed in the right place and I
                could not contain myself for joy; but immediately I lost all interest in the doll. During the
                whole trip I did not have one fit of temper, there were so many things to keep my mind and
                fingers busy.
                When we arrived in Baltimore, Dr. Chisholm received us kindly: but he could do nothing.
                He said, however, that I could be educated, and advised my father to consult Dr. Alexander
                Graham Bell of Washington, who would be able to give him information about schools and
                teachers of deaf or blind children. Acting on the doctor's advice, we went immediately to
                Washington to see Dr. Bell, my father with a sad heart and many misgivings, I wholly
                unconscious of his anguish, finding pleasure in the excitement of moving from place to place.
                Child as I was, I at once felt the tenderness and sympathy which endeared Dr. Bell to so many
                hearts, as his wonderful achievements enlist their admiration. He held me on his knee while I
                examined his watch, and he made it strike for me. He understood my signs, and I knew it and
                loved him at once. But I did not dream that that interview would be the door through which I
                should pass from darkness into light, from isolation to friendship, companionship, knowledge,
                love.
                Dr. Bell advised my father to write to Mr. Anagnos, director of the Perkins Institution in
                Boston, the scene of Dr. Howe's great labours for the blind, and ask him if he had a teacher
                competent to begin my education. This my father did at once, and in a few weeks there came a
                kind letter from Mr. Anagnos with the comforting assurance that a teacher had been found.
                This was in the summer of 1886. But Miss Sullivan did not arrive until the following March.
                Thus I came up out of Egypt and stood before Sinai, and a power divine touched my spirit
                and gave it sight, so that I beheld many wonders. And from the sacred mountain I heard a
                voice which said, "Knowledge is love and light and vision."</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 4</p>
            <div>The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne
                Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable
                contrasts between the two lives which it connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three
                months before I was seven years old.
                On the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb, expectant. I guessed
                vaguely from my mother's signs and from the hurrying to and fro in the house that something
                unusual was about to happen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps. The afternoon sun
                penetrated the mass of honeysuckle that covered the porch, and fell on my upturned face. My
                fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the familiar leaves and blossoms which had just
                come forth to greet the sweet southern spring. I did not know what the future held of marvel
                or surprise for me. Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for weeks and a deep
                languor had succeeded this passionate struggle.
                Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness
                shut you in, and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with
                plummet and soundingline,
                and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I
                was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or soundingline,
                and had no way of knowing how near the harbour was. "Light! give me light!" was the
                wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour.
                I felt approaching footsteps, I stretched out my hand as I supposed to my mother. Some one
                took it, and I was caught up and held close in the arms of her who had come to reveal all
                things to me, and, more than all things else, to love me.
                The morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me a doll. The little
                blind children at the Perkins Institution had sent it and Laura Bridgman had dressed it; but I
                did not know this until afterward. When I had played with it a little while, Miss Sullivan
                slowly spelled into my hand the word "doll."
                I was at once interested in this finger play and
                tried to imitate it. When I finally succeeded in making the letters correctly I was flushed with
                childish pleasure and pride. Running downstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made
                the letters for doll. I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed; I was
                simply making my fingers go in monkeylike
                imitation. In the days that followed I learned to
                spell in this uncomprehending way a great many words, among them pin, hat, cup and a few
                verbs like sit, stand and walk. But my teacher had been with me several weeks before I
                understood that everything has a name.
                One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my
                lap also, spelled "doll"
                and tried to make me understand that "doll"
                applied to both.
                Earlier in the day we had had a tussle over the words "mug"
                and "water."
                Miss Sullivan
                had tried to impress it upon me that "mug"
                is mug and that "water"
                is water, but I
                persisted in confounding the two. In despair she had dropped the subject for the time, only to
                renew it at the first opportunity. I became impatient at her repeated attempts and, seizing the
                new doll, I dashed it upon the floor. I was keenly delighted when I felt the fragments of the
                broken doll at my feet. Neither sorrow nor regret followed my passionate outburst. I had not
                loved the doll. In the still, dark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment or
                tenderness. I felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of the hearth, and I had a sense
                of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfort was removed. She brought me my hat, and I
                knew I was going out into the warm sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be
                called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.
                We walked down the path to the wellhouse,
                attracted by the fragrance of the honeysuckle
                with which it was covered. Some one was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand
                under the spout. As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word
                water, first slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her
                fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten—a thrill of returning
                thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me. I knew then that "water"
                meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word
                awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were barriers still, it is true, but
                barriers that could in time be swept away.
                I left the wellhouse
                eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each name gave birth to a
                new thought. As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with
                life. That was because I saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me. On
                entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way to the hearth and picked
                up the pieces. I tried vainly to put them together. Then my eyes filled with tears; for I realized
                what I had done, and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow.
                I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I do
                know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among them—words that were to make the
                world blossom for me, "like Aaron's rod, with flowers." It would have been difficult to find a
                happier child than I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful day and lived over the
                joys it had brought me, and for the first time longed for a new day to come.</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 5</p>
            <div>I recall many incidents of the summer of 1887 that followed my soul's sudden awakening. I
                did nothing but explore with my hands and learn the name of every object that I touched; and
                the more I handled things and learned their names and uses, the more joyous and confident
                grew my sense of kinship with the rest of the world.
                When the time of daisies and buttercups came Miss Sullivan took me by the hand across the
                fields, where men were preparing the earth for the seed, to the banks of the Tennessee River,
                and there, sitting on the warm grass, I had my first lessons in the beneficence of nature. I
                learned how the sun and the rain make to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasant to
                the sight and good for food, how birds build their nests and live and thrive from land to land,
                how the squirrel, the deer, the lion and every other creature finds food and shelter. As my
                knowledge of things grew I felt more and more the delight of the world I was in. Long before
                I learned to do a sum in arithmetic or describe the shape of the earth, Miss Sullivan had taught
                me to find beauty in the fragrant woods, in every blade of grass, and in the curves and dimples
                of my baby sister's hand. She linked my earliest thoughts with nature, and made me feel that
                "birds and flowers and I were happy peers."
                But about this time I had an experience which taught me that nature is not always kind. One
                day my teacher and I were returning from a long ramble. The morning had been fine, but it
                was growing warm and sultry when at last we turned our faces homeward. Two or three times
                we stopped to rest under a tree by the wayside. Our last halt was under a wild cherry tree a
                short distance from the house. The shade was grateful, and the tree was so easy to climb that
                with my teacher's assistance I was able to scramble to a seat in the branches. It was so cool up
                in the tree that Miss Sullivan proposed that we have our luncheon there. I promised to keep
                still while she went to the house to fetch it.
                Suddenly a change passed over the tree. All the sun's warmth left the air. I knew the sky
                was black, because all the heat, which meant light to me, had died out of the atmosphere. A
                strange odour came up from the earth. I knew it, it was the odour that always precedes a
                thunderstorm, and a nameless fear clutched at my heart. I felt absolutely alone, cut off from
                my friends and the firm earth. The immense, the unknown, enfolded me. I remained still and
                expectant; a chilling terror crept over me. I longed for my teacher's return; but above all things
                I wanted to get down from that tree.
                There was a moment of sinister silence, then a multitudinous stirring of the leaves. A shiver
                ran through the tree, and the wind sent forth a blast that would have knocked me off had I not
                clung to the branch with might and main. The tree swayed and strained. The small twigs
                snapped and fell about me in showers. A wild impulse to jump seized me, but terror held me
                fast. I crouched down in the fork of the tree. The branches lashed about me. I felt the
                intermittent jarring that came now and then, as if something heavy had fallen and the shock
                had traveled up till it reached the limb I sat on. It worked my suspense up to the highest point,
                and just as I was thinking the tree and I should fall together, my teacher seized my hand and
                helped me down. I clung to her, trembling with joy to feel the earth under my feet once more.
                I had learned a new lesson—that nature "wages open war against her children, and under
                softest touch hides treacherous claws."
                After this experience it was a long time before I climbed another tree. The mere thought
                filled me with terror. It was the sweet allurement of the mimosa tree in full bloom that finally
                overcame my fears. One beautiful spring morning when I was alone in the summerhouse,
                reading, I became aware of a wonderful subtle fragrance in the air. I started up and
                instinctively stretched out my hands. It seemed as if the spirit of spring had passed through the
                summerhouse.
                "What is it?" I asked, and the next minute I recognized the odour of the
                mimosa blossoms. I felt my way to the end of the garden, knowing that the mimosa tree was
                near the fence, at the turn of the path. Yes, there it was, all quivering in the warm sunshine, its
                blossomladen
                branches almost touching the long grass. Was there ever anything so
                exquisitely beautiful in the world before! Its delicate blossoms shrank from the slightest
                earthly touch; it seemed as if a tree of paradise had been transplanted to earth. I made my way
                through a shower of petals to the great trunk and for one minute stood irresolute; then, putting
                my foot in the broad space between the forked branches, I pulled myself up into the tree. I had
                some difficulty in holding on, for the branches were very large and the bark hurt my hands.
                But I had a delicious sense that I was doing something unusual and wonderful so I kept on
                climbing higher and higher, until I reached a little seat which somebody had built there so
                long ago that it had grown part of the tree itself. I sat there for a long, long time, feeling like a
                fairy on a rosy cloud. After that I spent many happy hours in my tree of paradise, thinking fair
                thoughts and dreaming bright dreams.</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 6</p>
            <div>I had now the key to all language, and I was eager to learn to use it. Children who hear
                acquire language without any particular effort; the words that fall from others' lips they catch
                on the wing, as it were, delightedly, while the little deaf child must trap them by a slow and
                often painful process. But whatever the process, the result is wonderful. Gradually from
                naming an object we advance step by step until we have traversed the vast distance between
                our first stammered syllable and the sweep of thought in a line of Shakespeare.
                At first, when my teacher told me about a new thing I asked very few questions. My ideas
                were vague, and my vocabulary was inadequate; but as my knowledge of things grew, and I
                learned more and more words, my field of inquiry broadened, and I would return again and
                again to the same subject, eager for further information. Sometimes a new word revived an
                image that some earlier experience had engraved on my brain.
                I remember the morning that I first asked the meaning of the word, "love." This was before
                I knew many words. I had found a few early violets in the garden and brought them to my
                teacher. She tried to kiss me: but at that time I did not like to have any one kiss me except my
                mother. Miss Sullivan put her arm gently round me and spelled into my hand, "I love Helen."
                "What is love?" I asked.
                She drew me closer to her and said, "It is here," pointing to my heart, whose beats I was
                conscious of for the first time. Her words puzzled me very much because I did not then
                understand anything unless I touched it.
                I smelt the violets in her hand and asked, half in words, half in signs, a question which
                meant, "Is love the sweetness of flowers?"
                "No," said my teacher.
                Again I thought. The warm sun was shining on us.
                "Is this not love?" I asked, pointing in the direction from which the heat came. "Is this not
                love?"
                It seemed to me that there could be nothing more beautiful than the sun, whose warmth
                makes all things grow. But Miss Sullivan shook her head, and I was greatly puzzled and
                disappointed. I thought it strange that my teacher could not show me love.
                A day or two afterward I was stringing beads of different sizes in symmetrical groups—two
                large beads, three small ones, and so on. I had made many mistakes, and Miss Sullivan had
                pointed them out again and again with gentle patience. Finally I noticed a very obvious error
                in the sequence and for an instant I concentrated my attention on the lesson and tried to think
                how I should have arranged the beads. Miss Sullivan touched my forehead and spelled with
                decided emphasis, "Think."
                In a flash I knew that the word was the name of the process that was going on in my head.
                This was my first conscious perception of an abstract idea.
                For a long time I was still—I was not thinking of the beads in my lap, but trying to find a
                meaning for "love" in the light of this new idea. The sun had been under a cloud all day, and
                there had been brief showers; but suddenly the sun broke forth in all its southern splendour.
                Again I asked my teacher, "Is this not love?"
                "Love is something like the clouds that were in the sky before the sun came out," she
                replied. Then in simpler words than these, which at that time I could not have understood, she
                explained: "You cannot touch the clouds, you know; but you feel the rain and know how glad
                the flowers and the thirsty earth are to have it after a hot day. You cannot touch love either;
                but you feel the sweetness that it pours into everything. Without love you would not be happy
                or want to play."
                The beautiful truth burst upon my mind—I felt that there were invisible lines stretched
                between my spirit and the spirits of others.
                From the beginning of my education Miss Sullivan made it a practice to speak to me as she
                would speak to any hearing child; the only difference was that she spelled the sentences into
                my hand instead of speaking them. If I did not know the words and idioms necessary to
                express my thoughts she supplied them, even suggesting conversation when I was unable to
                keep up my end of the dialogue.
                This process was continued for several years; for the deaf child does not learn in a month,
                or even in two or three years, the numberless idioms and expressions used in the simplest
                daily intercourse. The little hearing child learns these from constant repetition and imitation.
                The conversation he hears in his home stimulates his mind and suggests topics and calls forth
                the spontaneous expression of his own thoughts. This natural exchange of ideas is denied to
                the deaf child. My teacher, realizing this, determined to supply the kinds of stimulus I lacked.
                This she did by repeating to me as far as possible, verbatim, what she heard, and by showing
                me how I could take part in the conversation. But it was a long time before I ventured to take
                the initiative, and still longer before I could find something appropriate to say at the right
                time.
                The deaf and the blind find it very difficult to acquire the amenities of conversation. How
                much more this difficulty must be augmented in the case of those who are both deaf and
                blind! They cannot distinguish the tone of the voice or, without assistance, go up and down
                the gamut of tones that give significance to words; nor can they watch the expression of the
                speaker's face, and a look is often the very soul of what one says.</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 7</p>
            <div>As soon as I could spell a few words my teacher gave me slips of cardboard on which were
                printed words in raised letters. I quickly learned that each printed word stood for an object, an
                act, or a quality. I had a frame in which I could arrange the words in little sentences; but
                before I ever put sentences in the frame I used to make them in objects. I found the slips of
                paper which represented, for example, "doll," "is," "on," "bed" and placed each name on its
                object; then I put my doll on the bed with the words is, on, bed arranged beside the doll, thus
                making a sentence of the words, and at the same time carrying out the idea of the sentence
                with the things themselves.
                One day, Miss Sullivan tells me, I pinned the word girl on my pinafore and stood in the
                wardrobe. On the shelf I arranged the words, is, in, wardrobe. Nothing delighted me so much
                as this game. My teacher and I played it for hours at a time. Often everything in the room was
                arranged in object sentences.
                From the printed slip it was but a step to the printed book. I took my "Reader for
                Beginners" and hunted for the words I knew; when I found them my joy was like that of a
                game of hideandseek.
                Thus I began to read. Of the time when I began to read connected
                stories I shall speak later.
                For a long time I had no regular lessons. Even when I studied most earnestly it seemed
                more like play than work. Everything Miss Sullivan taught me she illustrated by a beautiful
                story or a poem. Whenever anything delighted or interested me she talked it over with me just
                as if she were a little girl herself. What many children think of with dread, as a painful
                plodding through grammar, hard sums and harder definitions, is today
                one of my most
                precious memories.
                I cannot explain the peculiar sympathy Miss Sullivan had with my pleasures and desires.
                Perhaps it was the result of long association with the blind. Added to this she had a wonderful
                faculty for description. She went quickly over uninteresting details, and never nagged me with
                questions to see if I remembered the daybeforeyesterday's
                lesson. She introduced dry
                technicalities of science little by little, making every subject so real that I could not help
                remembering what she taught.
                We read and studied out of doors, preferring the sunlit woods to the house. All my early
                lessons have in them the breath of the woods—the fine, resinous odour of pine needles,
                blended with the perfume of wild grapes. Seated in the gracious shade of a wild tulip tree, I
                learned to think that everything has a lesson and a suggestion. "The loveliness of things taught
                me all their use." Indeed, everything that could hum, or buzz, or sing, or bloom had a part in
                my educationnoisythroated
                frogs, katydids and crickets held in my hand until forgetting their
                embarrassment, they trilled their reedy note, little downy chickens and wildflowers, the
                dogwood blossoms, meadowviolets
                and budding fruit trees. I felt the bursting cottonbolls
                and fingered their soft fiber and fuzzy seeds; I felt the low soughing of the wind through the
                cornstalks, the silky rustling of the long leaves, and the indignant snort of my pony, as we
                caught him in the pasture and put the bit in his mouth—ah me! how well I remember the
                spicy, clovery smell of his breath!
                Sometimes I rose at dawn and stole into the garden while the heavy dew lay on the grass
                and flowers. Few know what joy it is to feel the roses pressing softly into the hand, or the
                beautiful motion of the lilies as they sway in the morning breeze. Sometimes I caught an
                insect in the flower I was plucking, and I felt the faint noise of a pair of wings rubbed together
                in a sudden terror, as the little creature became aware of a pressure from without.
                Another favourite haunt of mine was the orchard, where the fruit ripened early in July. The
                large, downy peaches would reach themselves into my hand, and as the joyous breezes flew
                about the trees the apples tumbled at my feet. Oh, the delight with which I gathered up the
                fruit in my pinafore, pressed my face against the smooth cheeks of the apples, still warm from
                the sun, and skipped back to the house!
                Our favourite walk was to Keller's Landing, an old tumbledown lumberwharf
                on the
                Tennessee River, used during the Civil War to land soldiers. There we spent many happy
                hours and played at learning geography. I built dams of pebbles, made islands and lakes, and
                dug riverbeds,
                all for fun, and never dreamed that I was learning a lesson. I listened with
                increasing wonder to Miss Sullivan's descriptions of the great round world with its burning
                mountains, buried cities, moving rivers of ice, and many other things as strange. She made
                raised maps in clay, so that I could feel the mountain ridges and valleys, and follow with my
                fingers the devious course of rivers. I liked this, too; but the division of the earth into zones
                and poles confused and teased my mind. The illustrative strings and the orange stick
                representing the poles seemed so real that even to this day the mere mention of temperate
                zone suggests a series of twine circles; and I believe that if any one should set about it he
                could convince me that white bears actually climb the North Pole.
                Arithmetic seems to have been the only study I did not like. From the first I was not
                interested in the science of numbers. Miss Sullivan tried to teach me to count by stringing
                beads in groups, and by arranging kintergarten straws I learned to add and subtract. I never
                had patience to arrange more than five or six groups at a time. When I had accomplished this
                my conscience was at rest for the day, and I went out quickly to find my playmates.
                In this same leisurely manner I studied zoology and botany.
                Once a gentleman, whose name I have forgotten, sent me a collection of fossils—tiny
                mollusk shells beautifully marked, and bits of sandstone with the print of birds' claws, and a
                lovely fern in basrelief.
                These were the keys which unlocked the treasures of the antediluvian
                world for me. With trembling fingers I listened to Miss Sullivan's descriptions of the terrible
                beasts, with uncouth, unpronounceable names, which once went tramping through the
                primeval forests, tearing down the branches of gigantic trees for food, and died in the dismal
                swamps of an unknown age. For a long time these strange creatures haunted my dreams, and
                this gloomy period formed a somber background to the joyous Now, filled with sunshine and
                roses and echoing with the gentle beat of my pony's hoof.
                Another time a beautiful shell was given me, and with a child's surprise and delight I
                learned how a tiny mollusk had built the lustrous coil for his dwelling place, and how on still
                nights, when there is no breeze stirring the waves, the Nautilus sails on the blue waters of the
                Indian Ocean in his "ship of pearl." After I had learned a great many interesting things about
                the life and habits of the children of the sea—how in the midst of dashing waves the little
                polyps build the beautiful coral isles of the Pacific, and the foraminifera have made the chalkhills
                of many a land—my teacher read me "The Chambered Nautilus," and showed me that
                the shellbuilding
                process of the mollusks is symbolical of the development of the mind. Just
                as the wonderworking
                mantle of the Nautilus changes the material it absorbs from the water
                and makes it a part of itself, so the bits of knowledge one gathers undergo a similar change
                and become pearls of thought.
                Again, it was the growth of a plant that furnished the text for a lesson. We bought a lily and
                set it in a sunny window. Very soon the green, pointed buds showed signs of opening. The
                slender, fingerlike leaves on the outside opened slowly, reluctant, I thought, to reveal the
                loveliness they hid; once having made a start, however, the opening process went on rapidly,
                but in order and systematically. There was always one bud larger and more beautiful than the
                rest, which pushed her outer, covering back with more pomp, as if the beauty in soft, silky
                robes knew that she was the lilyqueen
                by right divine, while her more timid sisters doffed
                their green hoods shyly, until the whole plant was one nodding bough of loveliness and
                fragrance.</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 8</p>
            <div>The first Christmas after Miss Sullivan came to Tuscumbia was a great event. Every one in
                the family prepared surprises for me, but what pleased me most, Miss Sullivan and I prepared
                surprises for everybody else. The mystery that surrounded the gifts was my greatest delight
                and amusement. My friends did all they could to excite my curiosity by hints and halfspelled
                sentences which they pretended to break off in the nick of time. Miss Sullivan and I kept up a
                game of guessing which taught me more about the use of language than any set lessons could
                have done. Every evening, seated round a glowing wood fire, we played our guessing game,
                which grew more and more exciting as Christmas approached.
                On Christmas Eve the Tuscumbia schoolchildren had their tree, to which they invited me.
                In the centre of the schoolroom stood a beautiful tree ablaze and shimmering in the soft light,
                its branches loaded with strange, wonderful fruit. It was a moment of supreme happiness. I
                danced and capered round the tree in an ecstasy. When I learned that there was a gift for each
                child, I was delighted, and the kind people who had prepared the tree permitted me to hand the
                presents to the children. In the pleasure of doing this, I did not stop to look at my own gifts;
                but when I was ready for them, my impatience for the real Christmas to begin almost got
                beyond control. I knew the gifts I already had were not those of which friends had thrown out
                such tantalizing hints, and my teacher said the presents I was to have would be even nicer than
                these. I was persuaded, however, to content myself with the gifts from the tree and leave the
                others until morning.
                That night, after I had hung my stocking, I lay awake a long time, pretending to be asleep
                and keeping alert to see what Santa Claus would do when he came. At last I fell asleep with a
                new doll and a white bear in my arms. Next morning it was I who waked the whole family
                with my first "Merry Christmas!" I found surprises, not in the stocking only, but on the table,
                on all the chairs, at the door, on the very windowsill;
                indeed, I could hardly walk without
                stumbling on a bit of Christmas wrapped up in tissue paper. But when my teacher presented
                me with a canary, my cup of happiness overflowed.
                Little Tim was so tame that he would hop on my finger and eat candied cherries out of my
                hand. Miss Sullivan taught me to take all the care of my new pet. Every morning after
                breakfast I prepared his bath, made his cage clean and sweet, filled his cups with fresh seed
                and water from the wellhouse,
                and hung a spray of chickweed in his swing.
                One morning I left the cage on the windowseat
                while I went to fetch water for his bath.
                When I returned I felt a big cat brush past me as I opened the door. At first I did not realize
                what had happened; but when I put my hand in the cage and Tim's pretty wings did not meet
                my touch or his small pointed claws take hold of my finger, I knew that I should never see my
                sweet little singer again</div>

            <div>The next important event in my life was my visit to Boston, in May, 1888. As if it were
                yesterday I remember the preparations, the departure with my teacher and my mother, the
                journey, and finally the arrival in Boston. How different this journey was from the one I had
                made to Baltimore two years before! I was no longer a restless, excitable little creature,
                requiring the attention of everybody on the train to keep me amused. I sat quietly beside Miss
                Sullivan, taking in with eager interest all that she told me about what she saw out of the car
                window: the beautiful Tennessee River, the great cottonfields,
                the hills and woods, and the
                crowds of laughing negroes at the stations, who waved to the people on the train and brought
                delicious candy and popcorn balls through the car. On the seat opposite me sat my big rag
                doll, Nancy, in a new gingham dress and a beruffled sunbonnet, looking at me out of two bead
                eyes. Sometimes, when I was not absorbed in Miss Sullivan's descriptions, I remembered
                Nancy's existence and took her up in my arms, but I generally calmed my conscience by
                making myself believe that she was asleep.
                As I shall not have occasion to refer to Nancy again, I wish to tell here a sad experience she
                had soon after our arrival in Boston. She was covered with dirt—the remains of mud pies I
                had compelled her to eat, although she had never shown any special liking for them. The
                laundress at the Perkins Institution secretly carried her off to give her a bath. This was too
                much for poor Nancy. When I next saw her she was a formless heap of cotton, which I should
                not have recognized at all except for the two bead eyes which looked out at me reproachfully.
                When the train at last pulled into the station at Boston it was as if a beautiful fairy tale had
                come true. The "once upon a time" was now; the "faraway
                country" was here.
                We had scarcely arrived at the Perkins Institution for the Blind when I began to make
                friends with the little blind children. It delighted me inexpressibly to find that they knew the
                manual alphabet. What joy to talk with other children in my own language! Until then I had
                been like a foreigner speaking through an interpreter. In the school where Laura Bridgman
                was taught I was in my own country. It took me some time to appreciate the fact that my new
                friends were blind. I knew I could not see; but it did not seem possible that all the eager,
                loving children who gathered round me and joined heartily in my frolics were also blind. I
                remember the surprise and the pain I felt as I noticed that they placed their hands over mine
                when I talked to them and that they read books with their fingers. Although I had been told
                this before, and although I understood my own deprivations, yet I had thought vaguely that
                since they could hear, they must have a sort of "second sight," and I was not prepared to find
                one child and another and yet another deprived of the same precious gift. But they were so
                happy and contented that I lost all sense of pain in the pleasure of their companionship.
                One day spent with the blind children made me feel thoroughly at home in my new
                environment, and I looked eagerly from one pleasant experience to another as the days flew
                swiftly by. I could not quite convince myself that there was much world left, for I regarded
                Boston as the beginning and the end of creation.</div>

            <div">Just before the Perkins Institution closed for the summer, it was arranged that my teacher
                and I should spend our vacation at Brewster, on Cape Cod, with our dear friend, Mrs.
                Hopkins. I was delighted, for my mind was full of the prospective joys and of the wonderful
                stories I had heard about the sea.
                My most vivid recollection of that summer is the ocean. I had always lived far inland and
                had never had so much as a whiff of salt air; but I had read in a big book called "Our World" a
                description of the ocean which filled me with wonder and an intense longing to touch the
                mighty sea and feel it roar. So my little heart leaped high with eager excitement when I knew
                that my wish was at last to be realized.
                No sooner had I been helped into my bathingsuit
                than I sprang out upon the warm sand and
                without thought of fear plunged into the cool water. I felt the great billows rock and sink. The
                buoyant motion of the water filled me with an exquisite, quivering joy. Suddenly my ecstasy
                gave place to terror; for my foot struck against a rock and the next instant there was a rush of
                water over my head. I thrust out my hands to grasp some support, I clutched at the water and
                at the seaweed which the waves tossed in my face. But all my frantic efforts were in vain. The
                waves seemed to be playing a game with me, and tossed me from one to another in their wild
                frolic. It was fearful! The good, firm earth had slipped from my feet, and everything seemed
                shut out from this strange, allenveloping
                element—life, air, warmth and love. At last,
                however, the sea, as if weary of its new toy, threw me back on the shore, and in another instant
                I was clasped in my teacher's arms. Oh, the comfort of the long, tender embrace! As soon as I
                had recovered from my panic sufficiently to say anything, I demanded: "Who put salt in the
                water?"
                After I had recovered from my first experience in the water, I thought it great fun to sit on a
                big rock in my bathingsuit
                and feel wave after wave dash against the rock, sending up a
                shower of spray which quite covered me. I felt the pebbles rattling as the waves threw their
                ponderous weight against the shore; the whole beach seemed racked by their terrific onset,
                and the air throbbed with their pulsations. The breakers would swoop back to gather
                themselves for a mightier leap, and I clung to the rock, tense, fascinated, as I felt the dash and
                roar of the rushing sea!</div>

            <div>In the autumn I returned to my Southern home with a heart full of joyous memories. As I
                recall that visit North I am filled with wonder at the richness and variety of the experiences
                that cluster about it. It seems to have been the beginning of everything. The treasures of a
                new, beautiful world were laid at my feet, and I took in pleasure and information at every turn.
                I lived myself into all things. I was never still a moment; my life was as full of motion as
                those little insects that crowd a whole existence into one brief day. I met many people who
                talked with me by spelling into my hand, and thought in joyous sympathy leaped up to meet
                thought, and behold, a miracle had been wrought! The barren places between my mind and the
                minds of others blossomed like the rose.
                I spent the autumn months with my family at our summer cottage, on a mountain about
                fourteen miles from Tuscumbia. It was called Fern Quarry, because near it there was a
                limestone quarry, long since abandoned. Three frolicsome little streams ran through it from
                springs in the rocks above, leaping here and tumbling there in laughing cascades wherever the
                rocks tried to bar their way. The opening was filled with ferns which completely covered the
                beds of limestone and in places hid the streams. The rest of the mountain was thickly wooded.
                Here were great oaks and splendid evergreens with trunks like mossy pillars, from the
                branches of which hung garlands of ivy and mistletoe, and persimmon trees, the odour of
                which pervaded every nook and corner of the wood—an illusive, fragrant something that
                made the heart glad. In places the wild muscadine and scuppernong vines stretched from tree
                to tree, making arbours which were always full of butterflies and buzzing insects. It was
                delightful to lose ourselves in the green hollows of that tangled wood in the late afternoon,
                and to smell the cool, delicious odours that came up from the earth at the close of day.
                Our cottage was a sort of rough camp, beautifully situated on the top of the mountain
                among oaks and pines. The small rooms were arranged on each side of a long open hall.
                Round the house was a wide piazza, where the mountain winds blew, sweet with all woodscents.
                We lived on the piazza most of the time—there we worked, ate and played. At the back
                door there was a great butternut tree, round which the steps had been built, and in front the
                trees stood so close that I could touch them and feel the wind shake their branches, or the
                leaves twirl downward in the autumn blast.
                Many visitors came to Fern Quarry.</div>

            <div>The withered grass and the bushes were transformed into a forest of icicles.
                Then came a day when the chill air portended a snowstorm. We rushed outofdoors
                to feel
                the first few tiny flakes descending. Hour by hour the flakes dropped silently, softly from their
                airy height to the earth, and the country became more and more level. A snowy night closed
                upon the world, and in the morning one could scarcely recognize a feature of the landscape.
                All the roads were hidden, not a single landmark was visible, only a waste of snow with trees
                rising out of it.
                In the evening a wind from the northeast sprang up, and the flakes rushed hither and thither
                in furious melee. Around the great fire we sat and told merry tales, and frolicked, and quite
                forgot that we were in the midst of a desolate solitude, shut in from all communication with
                the outside world. But during the night the fury of the wind increased to such a degree that it
                thrilled us with a vague terror. The rafters creaked and strained, and the branches of the trees
                surrounding the house rattled and beat against the windows, as the winds rioted up and down
                the country.
                On the third day after the beginning of the storm the snow ceased. The sun broke through
                the clouds and shone upon a vast, undulating white plain. High mounds, pyramids heaped in
                fantastic shapes, and impenetrable drifts lay scattered in every direction.
                Narrow paths were shoveled through the drifts. I put on my cloak and hood and went out.
                The air stung my cheeks like fire. Half walking in the paths, half working our way through the
                lesser drifts, we succeeded in reaching a pine grove just outside a broad pasture. The trees
                stood motionless and white like figures in a marble frieze. There was no odour of pineneedles.
                The rays of the sun fell upon the trees, so that the twigs sparkled like diamonds and
                dropped in showers when we touched them. So dazzling was the light, it penetrated even the
                darkness that veils my eyes.
                As the days wore on, the drifts gradually shrunk, but before they were wholly gone another
                storm came, so that I scarcely felt the earth under my feet once all winter. At intervals the
                trees lost their icy covering, and the bulrushes and underbrush were bare; but the lake lay
                frozen and hard beneath the sun.
                Our favourite amusement during that winter was tobogganing. In places the shore of the
                lake rises abruptly from the water's edge. Down these steep slopes we used to coast. We
                would get on our toboggan, a boy would give us a shove, and off we went! Plunging through
                drifts, leaping hollows, swooping down upon the lake, we would shoot across its gleaming
                surface to the opposite bank. What joy! What exhilarating madness! For one wild, glad
                moment we snapped the chain that binds us to earth, and joining hands with the winds we felt
                ourselves divine!</div>

            <div>It was in the spring of 1890 that I learned to speak. The impulse to utter audible sounds had
                always been strong within me. I used to make noises, keeping one hand on my throat while
                the other hand felt the movements of my lips. I was pleased with anything that made a noise
                and liked to feel the cat purr and the dog bark. I also liked to keep my hand on a singer's
                throat, or on a piano when it was being played. Before I lost my sight and hearing, I was fast
                learning to talk, but after my illness it was found that I had ceased to speak because I could
                not hear. I used to sit in my mother's lap all day long and keep my hands on her face because it
                amused me to feel the motions of her lips; and I moved my lips, too, although I had forgotten
                what talking was. My friends say that I laughed and cried naturally, and for awhile I made
                many sounds and wordelements,
                not because they were a means of communication, but
                because the need of exercising my vocal organs was imperative. There was, however, one
                word the meaning of which I still remembered, WATER. I pronounced it "wawa."
                Even this
                became less and less intelligible until the time when Miss Sullivan began to teach me. I
                stopped using it only after I had learned to spell the word on my fingers.
                I had known for a long time that the people about me used a method of communication
                different from mine; and even before I knew that a deaf child could be taught to speak, I was
                conscious of dissatisfaction with the means of communication I already possessed. One who
                is entirely dependent upon the manual alphabet has always a sense of restraint, of narrowness.
                This feeling began to agitate me with a vexing, forwardreaching
                sense of a lack that should
                be filled. My thoughts would often rise and beat up like birds against the wind, and I persisted
                in using my lips and voice. Friends tried to discourage this tendency, fearing lest it would lead
                to disappointment. But I persisted, and an accident soon occurred which resulted in the
                breaking down of this great barrier—I heard the story of Ragnhild Kaata.
                In 1890 Mrs. Lamson, who had been one of Laura Bridgman's teachers, and who had just
                returned from a visit to Norway and Sweden, came to see me, and told me of Ragnhild Kaata,
                a deaf and blind girl in Norway who had actually been taught to speak. Mrs. Lamson had
                scarcely finished telling me about this girl's success before I was on fire with eagerness. I
                resolved that I, too, would learn to speak. I would not rest satisfied until my teacher took me,
                for advice and assistance, to Miss Sarah Fuller, principal of the Horace Mann School. This
                lovely, sweetnatured
                lady offered to teach me herself, and we began the twentysixth
                of
                March, 1890.</div>

            <p class="sec-head">Chapter 14</p>
            <div>The winter of 1892 was darkened by the one cloud in my childhood's bright sky. Joy
                deserted my heart, and for a long, long time I lived in doubt, anxiety and fear. Books lost their
                charm for me, and even now the thought of those dreadful days chills my heart. A little story
                called "The Frost King," which I wrote and sent to Mr. Anagnos, of the Perkins Institution for
                the Blind, was at the root of the trouble. In order to make the matter clear, I must set forth the
                facts connected with this episode, which justice to my teacher and to myself compels me to
                relate.
                I wrote the story when I was at home, the autumn after I had learned to speak. We had
                stayed up at Fern Quarry later than usual. While we were there, Miss Sullivan had described
                to me the beauties of the late foliage, and it seems that her descriptions revived the memory of
                a story, which must have been read to me, and which I must have unconsciously retained. I
                thought then that I was "making up a story," as children say, and I eagerly sat down to write it
                before the ideas should slip from me. My thoughts flowed easily; I felt a sense of joy in the
                composition. Words and images came tripping to my finger ends, and as I thought out
                sentence after sentence, I wrote them on my braille slate. Now, if words and images come to
                me without effort, it is a pretty sure sign that they are not the offspring of my own mind, but
                stray waifs that I regretfully dismiss. At that time I eagerly absorbed everything I read without
                a thought of authorship, and even now I cannot be quite sure of the boundary line between my
                ideas and those I find in books. I suppose that is because so many of my impressions come to
                me through the medium of others' eyes and ears.
                When the story was finished, I read it to my teacher, and I recall now vividly the pleasure I
                felt in the more beautiful passages, and my annoyance at being interrupted to have the
                pronunciation of a word corrected. At dinner it was read to the assembled family, who were
                surprised that I could write so well. Some one asked me if I had read it in a book.
                This question surprised me very much; for I had not the faintest recollection of having had
                it read to me. I spoke up and said, "Oh, no, it is my story, and I have written it for Mr.
                Anagnos."
                Accordingly I copied the story and sent it to him for his birthday. It was suggested that I
                should change the title from "Autumn Leaves" to "The Frost King," which I did. I carried the
                little story to the postoffice
                myself, feeling as if I were walking on air. I little dreamed how
                cruelly I should pay for that birthday gift.
                Mr. Anagnos was delighted with "The Frost King," and published it in one of the Perkins
                Institution reports. This was the pinnacle of my happiness, from which I was in a little while
                dashed to earth. I had been in Boston only a short time when it was discovered that a story
                similar to "The Frost King," called "The Frost Fairies" by Miss Margaret T. Canby, had
                appeared before I was born in a book called "Birdie and His Friends." The two stories were so
                much alike in thought and language that it was evident Miss Canby's story had been read to
                me, and that mine was—a plagiarism. It was difficult to make me understand this; but when I
                did understand I was astonished and grieved. No child ever drank deeper of the cup of
                bitterness than I did. I had disgraced myself; I had brought suspicion upon those I loved best.
                And yet how could it possibly have happened? I racked my brain until I was weary to recall
                anything about the frost that I had read before I wrote "The Frost King"; but I could remember
                nothing, except the common reference to Jack Frost, and a poem for children, "The Freaks of
                the Frost," and I knew I had not used that in my composition.

            <div>The summer and winter following the "Frost King" incident I spent with my family in
                Alabama. I recall with delight that homegoing.
                Everything had budded and blossomed. I was
                happy. "The Frost King" was forgotten.
                When the ground was strewn with the crimson and golden leaves of autumn, and the muskscented
                grapes that covered the arbour at the end of the garden were turning golden brown in
                the sunshine, I began to write a sketch of my life—a year after I had written "The Frost King."
                I was still excessively scrupulous about everything I wrote. The thought that what I wrote
                might not be absolutely my own tormented me. No one knew of these fears except my teacher.
                A strange sensitiveness prevented me from referring to the "Frost King"; and often when an
                idea flashed out in the course of conversation I would spell softly to her, "I am not sure it is
                mine." At other times, in the midst of a paragraph I was writing, I said to myself, "Suppose it
                should be found that all this was written by some one long ago!" An impish fear clutched my
                hand, so that I could not write any more that day. And even now I sometimes feel the same
                uneasiness and disquietude. Miss Sullivan consoled and helped me in every way she could
                think of; but the terrible experience I had passed through left a lasting impression on my mind,
                the significance of which I am only just beginning to understand. It was with the hope of
                restoring my selfconfidence
                that she persuaded me to write for the Youth's Companion a brief
                account of my life. I was then twelve years old. As I look back on my struggle to write that
                little story, it seems to me that I must have had a prophetic vision of the good that would come
                of the undertaking, or I should surely have failed.
                I wrote timidly, fearfully, but resolutely, urged on by my teacher, who knew that if I
                persevered, I should find my mental foothold again and get a grip on my faculties. Up to the
                time of the "Frost King" episode, I had lived the unconscious life of a little child; now my
                thoughts were turned inward, and I beheld things invisible. Gradually I emerged from the
                penumbra of that experience with a mind made clearer by trial and with a truer knowledge of
                life.
                The chief events of the year 1893 were my trip to Washington during the inauguration of
                President Cleveland, and visits to Niagara and the World's Fair. Under such circumstances my
                studies were constantly interrupted and often put aside for many weeks, so that it is
                impossible for me to give a connected account of them.
                We went to Niagara in March, 1893. It is difficult to describe my emotions when I stood on
                the point which overhangs the American Falls and felt the air vibrate and the earth tremble.
                It seems strange to many people that I should be impressed by the wonders and beauties of
                Niagara. They are always asking: "What does this beauty or that music mean to you? You
                cannot see the waves rolling up the beach or hear their roar. What do they mean to you?" In
                the most evident sense they mean everything. I cannot fathom or define their meaning any
                more than I can fathom or define love or religion or goodness.
                During the summer of 1893, Miss Sullivan and I visited the World's Fair with Dr.
                Alexander Graham Bell. I recall with unmixed delight those days when a thousand childish
                fancies became beautiful realities. Every day in imagination I made a trip round the world,
                and I saw many wonders from the uttermost parts of the earth—marvels of invention,
                treasuries of industry and skill and all the activities of human life actually passed under my
                finger tips.</div>

            <div>Before October, 1893, I had studied various subjects by myself in a more or less desultory
                manner. I read the histories of Greece, Rome and the United States. I had a French grammar in
                raised print, and as I already knew some French, I often amused myself by composing in my
                head short exercises, using the new words as I came across them, and ignoring rules and other
                technicalities as much as possible. I even tried, without aid, to master the French
                pronunciation, as I found all the letters and sounds described in the book. Of course this was
                tasking slender powers for great ends; but it gave me something to do on a rainy day, and I
                acquired a sufficient knowledge of French to read with pleasure La Fontaine's "Fables," "Le
                Medecin Malgre Lui" and passages from "Athalie."
                I also gave considerable time to the improvement of my speech. I read aloud to Miss
                Sullivan and recited passages from my favourite poets, which I had committed to memory;
                she corrected my pronunciation and helped me to phrase and inflect. It was not, however, until
                October, 1893, after I had recovered from the fatigue and excitement of my visit to the
                World's Fair, that I began to have lessons in special subjects at fixed hours.
                Miss Sullivan and I were at that time in Hulton, Pennsylvania, visiting the family of Mr.
                William Wade. Mr. Irons, a neighbour of theirs, was a good Latin scholar; it was arranged that
                I should study under him. I remember him as a man of rare, sweet nature and of wide
                experience. He taught me Latin grammar principally; but he often helped me in arithmetic,
                which I found as troublesome as it was uninteresting. Mr. Irons also read with me Tennyson's
                "In Memoriam." I had read many books before, but never from a critical point of view. I
                learned for the first time to know an author, to recognize his style as I recognize the clasp of a
                friend's hand.
                At first I was rather unwilling to study Latin grammar. It seemed absurd to waste time
                analyzing, every word I came across—noun, genitive, singular, feminine—when its meaning
                was quite plain. I thought I might just as well describe my pet in order to know it—order,
                vertebrate; division, quadruped; class, mammalia; genus, felinus; species, cat; individual,
                Tabby. But as I got deeper into the subject, I became more interested, and the beauty of the
                language delighted me. I often amused myself by reading Latin passages, picking up words I
                understood and trying to make sense. I have never ceased to enjoy this pastime.
                There is nothing more beautiful, I think, than the evanescent fleeting images and sentiments
                presented by a language one is just becoming familiar with—ideas that flit across the mental
                sky, shaped and tinted by capricious fancy. Miss Sullivan sat beside me at my lessons, spelling
                into my hand whatever Mr. Irons said, and looking up new words for me. I was just beginning
                to read Caesar's "Gallic War" when I went to my home in Alabama.</div>

            <div>to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf. There it was arranged that I should go to the
                WrightHumason
                School for the Deaf in New York City. I went there in October, 1894,
                accompanied by Miss Sullivan. This school was chosen especially for the purpose of
                obtaining the highest advantages in vocal culture and training in lipreading.
                In addition to my
                work in these subjects, I studied, during the two years I was in the school, arithmetic, physical
                geography, French and German.
                Miss Reamy, my German teacher, could use the manual alphabet, and after I had acquired a
                small vocabulary, we talked together in German whenever we had a chance, and in a few
                months I could understand almost everything she said. Before the end of the first year I read
                "Wilhelm Tell" with the greatest delight. Indeed, I think I made more progress in German than
                in any of my other studies. I found French much more difficult. I studied it with Madame
                Olivier, a French lady who did not know the manual alphabet, and who was obliged to give
                her instruction orally. I could not read her lips easily; so my progress was much slower than in
                German. I managed, however, to read "Le Medecin Malgre Lui" again. It was very amusing
                but I did not like it nearly so well as "Wilhelm Tell."
                My progress in lipreading
                and speech was not what my teachers and I had hoped and
                expected it would be. It was my ambition to speak like other people, and my teachers believed
                that this could be accomplished; but, although we worked hard and faithfully, yet we did not
                quite reach our goal. I suppose we aimed too high, and disappointment was therefore
                inevitable. I still regarded arithmetic as a system of pitfalls. I hung about the dangerous
                frontier of "guess," avoiding with infinite trouble to myself and others the broad valley of
                reason. When I was not guessing, I was jumping at conclusions, and this fault, in addition to
                my dullness, aggravated my difficulties more than was right or necessary.
                But although these disappointments caused me great depression at times, I pursued my
                other studies with unflagging interest, especially physical geography. It was a joy to learn the
                secrets of nature: how—in the picturesque language of the Old Testament—the winds are
                made to blow from the four corners of the heavens, how the vapours ascend from the ends of
                the earth, how rivers are cut out among the rocks, and mountains overturned by the roots, and
                in what ways man may overcome many forces mightier than himself. The two years in New
                York were happy ones, and I look back to them with genuine pleasure.
                I remember especially the walks we all took together every day in Central Park, the only
                part of the city that was congenial to me. I never lost a jot of my delight in this great park. I
                loved to have it described every time I entered it; for it was beautiful in all its aspects, and
                these aspects were so many that it was beautiful in a different way each day of the nine
                months I spent in New York.</div>

            <div>In October, 1896, I entered the Cambridge School for Young Ladies, to be prepared for
                Radcliffe.
                When I was a little girl, I visited Wellesley and surprised my friends by the announcement,
                "Some day I shall go to college—but I shall go to Harvard!" When asked why I would not go
                to Wellesley, I replied that there were only girls there. The thought of going to college took
                root in my heart and became an earnest desire, which impelled me to enter into competition
                for a degree with seeing and hearing girls, in the face of the strong opposition of many true
                and wise friends. When I left New York the idea had become a fixed purpose; and it was
                decided that I should go to Cambridge. This was the nearest approach I could get to Harvard
                and to the fulfillment of my childish declaration.
                At the Cambridge School the plan was to have Miss Sullivan attend the classes with me and
                interpret to me the instruction given.
                Of course my instructors had had no experience in teaching any but normal pupils, and my
                only means of conversing with them was reading their lips. My studies for the first year were
                English history, English literature, German, Latin, arithmetic, Latin composition and
                occasional themes. Until then I had never taken a course of study with the idea of preparing
                for college; but I had been well drilled in English by Miss Sullivan, and it soon became
                evident to my teachers that I needed no special instruction in this subject beyond a critical
                study of the books prescribed by the college. I had had, moreover, a good start in French, and
                received six months' instruction in Latin; but German was the subject with which I was most
                familiar.
                In spite, however, of these advantages, there were serious drawbacks to my progress. Miss
                Sullivan could not spell out in my hand all that the books required, and it was very difficult to
                have textbooks embossed in time to be of use to me, although my friends in London and
                Philadelphia were willing to hasten the work. For a while, indeed, I had to copy my Latin in
                braille, so that I could recite with the other girls. My instructors soon became sufficiently
                familiar with my imperfect speech to answer my questions readily and correct mistakes. I
                could not make notes in class or write exercises; but I wrote all my compositions and
                translations at home on my typewriter.
                Each day Miss Sullivan went to the classes with me and spelled into my hand with infinite
                patience all that the teachers said. In study hours she had to look up new words for me and
                read and reread notes and books I did not have in raised print. The tedium of that work is hard
                to conceive. Frau Grote, my German teacher, and Mr. Gilman, the principal, were the only
                teachers in the school who learned the finger alphabet to give me instruction. No one realized
                more fully than dear Frau Grote how slow and inadequate her spelling was. Nevertheless, in
                the goodness of her heart she laboriously spelled out her instructions to me in special lessons
                twice a week, to give Miss Sullivan a little rest. But, though everybody was kind and ready to
                help us, there was only one hand that could turn drudgery into pleasure.</div>

            <div>When I began my second year at the Gilman school, I was full of hope and determination to
                succeed. But during the first few weeks I was confronted with unforeseen difficulties. Mr.
                Gilman had agreed that that year I should study mathematics principally. I had physics,
                algebra, geometry, astronomy, Greek and Latin. Unfortunately, many of the books I needed
                had not been embossed in time for me to begin with the classes, and I lacked important
                apparatus for some of my studies. The classes I was in were very large, and it was impossible
                for the teachers to give me special instruction. Miss Sullivan was obliged to read all the books
                to me, and interpret for the instructors, and for the first time in eleven years it seemed as if her
                dear hand would not be equal to the task.
                It was necessary for me to write algebra and geometry in class and solve problems in
                physics, and this I could not do until we bought a braille writer, by means of which I could put
                down the steps and processes of my work. I could not follow with my eyes the geometrical
                figures drawn on the blackboard, and my only means of getting a clear idea of them was to
                make them on a cushion with straight and curved wires, which had bent and pointed ends. I
                had to carry in my mind, as Mr. Keith says in his report, the lettering of the figures, the
                hypothesis and conclusion, the construction and the process of the proof. In a word, every
                study had its obstacles. Sometimes I lost all courage and betrayed my feelings in a way I am
                ashamed to remember, especially as the signs of my trouble were afterward used against Miss
                Sullivan, the only person of all the kind friends I had there, who could make the crooked
                straight and the rough places smooth.
                Little by little, however, my difficulties began to disappear. The embossed books and other
                apparatus arrived, and I threw myself into the work with renewed confidence. Algebra and
                geometry were the only studies that continued to defy my efforts to comprehend them. As I
                have said before, I had no aptitude for mathematics; the different points were not explained to
                me as fully as I wished. The geometrical diagrams were particularly vexing because I could
                not see the relation of the different parts to one another, even on the cushion. It was not until
                Mr. Keith taught me that I had a clear idea of mathematics.
                I was beginning to overcome these difficulties when an event occurred which changed
                everything.
                Just before the books came, Mr. Gilman had begun to remonstrate with Miss Sullivan on
                the ground that I was working too hard, and in spite of my earnest protestations, he reduced
                the number of my recitations. At the beginning we had agreed that I should, if necessary, take
                five years to prepare for college, but at the end of the first year the success of my
                examinations showed Miss Sullivan, Miss Harbaugh (Mr. Gilman's head teacher), and one
                other, that I could without too much effort complete my preparation in two years more. Mr.
                Gilman at first agreed to this; but when my tasks had become somewhat perplexing, he
                insisted that I was overworked, and that I should remain at his school three years longer. I did
                not like his plan, for I wished to enter college with my class.</div>

            <div>The struggle for admission to college was ended, and I could now enter Radcliffe whenever
                I pleased. Before I entered college, however, it was thought best that I should study another
                year under Mr. Keith. It was not, therefore, until the fall of 1900 that my dream of going to
                college was realized.
                I remember my first day at Radcliffe. It was a day full of interest for me. I had looked
                forward to it for years. A potent force within me, stronger than the persuasion of my friends,
                stronger even than the pleadings of my heart, had impelled me to try my strength by the
                standards of those who see and hear. I knew that there were obstacles in the way; but I was
                eager to overcome them. I had taken to heart the words of the wise Roman who said, "To be
                banished from Rome is but to live outside of Rome." Debarred from the great highways of
                knowledge, I was compelled to make the journey across country by unfrequented roads—that
                was all; and I knew that in college there were many bypaths where I could touch hands with
                girls who were thinking, loving and struggling like me.
                I began my studies with eagerness. Before me I saw a new world opening in beauty and
                light, and I felt within me the capacity to know all things. In the wonderland of Mind I should
                be as free as another. Its people, scenery, manners, joys, tragedies should be living, tangible
                interpreters of the real world. The lecturehalls
                seemed filled with the spirit of the great and
                the wise, and I thought the professors were the embodiment of wisdom. If I have since learned
                differently, I am not going to tell anybody.
                But I soon discovered that college was not quite the romantic lyceum I had imagined. Many
                of the dreams that had delighted my young inexperience became beautifully less and "faded
                into the light of common day." Gradually I began to find that there were disadvantages in
                going to college.
                The one I felt and still feel most is lack of time. I used to have time to think, to reflect, my
                mind and I. We would sit together of an evening and listen to the inner melodies of the spirit,
                which one hears only in leisure moments when the words of some loved poet touch a deep,
                sweet chord in the soul that until then had been silent. But in college there is no time to
                commune with one's thoughts. One goes to college to learn, it seems, not to think. When one
                enters the portals of learning, one leaves the dearest pleasures—solitude, books and
                imagination—outside with the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the
                thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I am improvident enough to
                prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day.
                My studies the first year were French, German, history, English composition and English
                literature. In the French course I read some of the works of Corneille, Moliere, Racine, Alfred
                de Musset and SainteBeuve,
                and in the German those of Goethe and Schiller. I reviewed
                rapidly the whole period of history from the fall of the Roman Empire to the eighteenth
                century, and in English literature studied critically Milton's poems and "Areopagitica."</div>

            <div>I have thus far sketched the events of my life, but I have not shown how much I have
                depended on books not only for pleasure and for the wisdom they bring to all who read, but
                also for that knowledge which comes to others through their eyes and their ears. Indeed, books
                have meant so much more in my education than in that of others, that I shall go back to the
                time when I began to read.
                I read my first connected story in May, 1887, when I was seven years old, and from that day
                to this I have devoured everything in the shape of a printed page that has come within the
                reach of my hungry finger tips. As I have said, I did not study regularly during the early years
                of my education; nor did I read according to rule.
                At first I had only a few books in raised print—"readers" for beginners, a collection of
                stories for children, and a book about the earth called "Our World." I think that was all; but I
                read them over and over, until the words were so worn and pressed I could scarcely make
                them out. Sometimes Miss Sullivan read to me, spelling into my hand little stories and poems
                that she knew I should understand; but I preferred reading myself to being read to, because I
                liked to read again and again the things that pleased me.
                It was during my first visit to Boston that I really began to read in good earnest. I was
                permitted to spend a part of each day in the Institution library, and to wander from bookcase
                to bookcase, and take down whatever book my fingers lighted upon. And read I did, whether I
                understood one word in ten or two words on a page. The words themselves fascinated me; but
                I took no conscious account of what I read. My mind must, however, have been very
                impressionable at that period, for it retained many words and whole sentences, to the meaning
                of which I had not the faintest clue; and afterward, when I began to talk and write, these
                words and sentences would flash out quite naturally, so that my friends wondered at the
                richness of my vocabulary. I must have read parts of many books (in those early days I think I
                never read any one book through) and a great deal of poetry in this uncomprehending way,
                until I discovered "Little Lord Fauntleroy," which was the first book of any consequence I
                read understandingly.
                One day my teacher found me in a corner of the library poring over the pages of "The
                Scarlet Letter." I was then about eight years old. I remember she asked me if I liked little
                Pearl, and explained some of the words that had puzzled me. Then she told me that she had a
                beautiful story about a little boy which she was sure I should like better than "The Scarlet
                Letter." The name of the story was "Little Lord Fauntleroy," and she promised to read it to me
                the following summer. But we did not begin the story until August; the first few weeks of my
                stay at the seashore were so full of discoveries and excitement that I forgot the very existence
                of books. Then my teacher went to visit some friends in Boston, leaving me for a short time.</div>

            <div>my only pleasure; my pleasures and amusements are many and varied.
                More than once in the course of my story I have referred to my love of the country and outofdoor
                sports. When I was quite a little girl, I learned to row and swim, and during the
                summer, when I am at Wrentham, Massachusetts, I almost live in my boat. Nothing gives me
                greater pleasure than to take my friends out rowing when they visit me. Of course, I cannot
                guide the boat very well. Some one usually sits in the stern and manages the rudder while I
                row. Sometimes, however, I go rowing without the rudder. It is fun to try to steer by the scent
                of watergrasses and lilies, and of bushes that grow on the shore. I use oars with leather bands,
                which keep them in position in the oarlocks, and I know by the resistance of the water when
                the oars are evenly poised. In the same manner I can also tell when I am pulling against the
                current. I like to contend with wind and wave. What is more exhilarating than to make your
                staunch little boat, obedient to your will and muscle, go skimming lightly over glistening,
                tilting waves, and to feel the steady, imperious surge of the water!
                I also enjoy canoeing, and I suppose you will smile when I say that I especially like it on
                moonlight nights. I cannot, it is true, see the moon climb up the sky behind the pines and steal
                softly across the heavens, making a shining path for us to follow; but I know she is there, and
                as I lie back among the pillows and put my hand in the water, I fancy that I feel the shimmer
                of her garments as she passes. Sometimes a daring little fish slips between my fingers, and
                often a pondlily
                presses shyly against my hand. Frequently, as we emerge from the shelter of
                a cove or inlet, I am suddenly conscious of the spaciousness of the air about me. A luminous
                warmth seems to enfold me. Whether it comes from the trees which have been heated by the
                sun, or from the water, I can never discover. I have had the same strange sensation even in the
                heart of the city. I have felt it on cold, stormy days and at night. It is like the kiss of warm lips
                on my face.
                My favourite amusement is sailing. In the summer of 1901 I visited Nova Scotia, and had
                opportunities such as I had not enjoyed before to make the acquaintance of the ocean. After
                spending a few days in Evangeline's country, about which Longfellow's beautiful poem has
                woven a spell of enchantment, Miss Sullivan and I went to Halifax, where we remained the
                greater part of the summer. The harbour was our joy, our paradise. What glorious sails we had
                to Bedford Basin, to McNabb's Island, to York Redoubt, and to the Northwest Arm! And at
                night what soothing, wondrous hours we spent in the shadow of the great, silent menofwar.
                Oh, it was all so interesting, so beautiful! The memory of it is a joy forever.
                One day we had a thrilling experience. There was a regatta in the Northwest Arm, in which
                the boats from the different warships were engaged. We went in a sailboat
                along with many
                others to watch the races. Hundreds of little sailboats
                swung to and fro close by, and the sea
                was calm. When the races were over, and we turned our faces homeward, one of the party
                noticed a black cloud drifting in from the sea, which grew and spread and thickened until it
                covered the whole sky. The wind rose, and the waves chopped angrily at unseen barriers. Our
                little boat confronted the gale fearlessly; with sails spread and ropes taut, she seemed to sit
                upon the wind. Now she swirled in the billows, now she spring upward on a gigantic wave,
                only to be driven down with angry howl and hiss. Down came the mainsail. Tacking and
                jibbing, we wrestled with opposing winds that drove us from side to side with impetuous fury.
                Our hearts beat fast, and our hands trembled with excitement, not fear, for we had the hearts
                of vikings, and we knew that our skipper was master of the situation. He had steered through
                many a storm with firm hand and seawise
                eye. As they passed us, the large craft and the
                gunboats in the harbour saluted and the seamen shouted applause for the master of the only
                little sailboat
                that ventured out into the storm. At last, cold, hungry and weary, we reached
                our pier.</div>

            <div>Would that I could enrich this sketch with the names of all those who have ministered to my
                happiness! Some of them would be found written in our literature and dear to the hearts of
                many, while others would be wholly unknown to most of my readers. But their influence,
                though it escapes fame, shall live immortal in the lives that have been sweetened and
                ennobled by it. Those are redletter
                days in our lives when we meet people who thrill us like a
                fine poem, people whose handshake is brimful of unspoken sympathy, and whose sweet, rich
                natures impart to our eager, impatient spirits a wonderful restfulness which, in its essence, is
                divine. The perplexities, irritations and worries that have absorbed us pass like unpleasant
                dreams, and we wake to see with new eyes and hear with new ears the beauty and harmony of
                God's real world. The solemn nothings that fill our everyday life blossom suddenly into bright
                possibilities. In a word, while such friends are near us we feel that all is well. Perhaps we
                never saw them before, and they may never cross our life's path again; but the influence of
                their calm, mellow natures is a libation poured upon our discontent, and we feel its healing
                touch, as the ocean feels the mountain stream freshening its brine.
                I have often been asked, "Do not people bore you?" I do not understand quite what that
                means. I suppose the calls of the stupid and curious, especially of newspaper reporters, are
                always inopportune. I also dislike people who try to talk down to my understanding. They are
                like people who when walking with you try to shorten their steps to suit yours; the hypocrisy
                in both cases is equally exasperating.
                The hands of those I meet are dumbly eloquent to me. The touch of some hands is an
                impertinence. I have met people so empty of joy, that when I clasped their frosty finger tips, it
                seemed as if I were shaking hands with a northeast storm. Others there are whose hands have
                sunbeams in them, so that their grasp warms my heart. It may be only the clinging touch of a
                child's hand; but there is as much potential sunshine in it for me as there is in a loving glance
                for others. A hearty handshake or a friendly letter gives me genuine pleasure.
                I have many faroff
                friends whom I have never seen. Indeed they are so many that I have
                often been unable to reply to their letters; but I wish to say here that I am always grateful for
                their kind words, however insufficiently I acknowledge them.
                I count it one of the sweetest privileges of my life to have known and conversed with many
                men of genius. Only those who knew Bishop Brooks can appreciate the joy his friendship was
                to those who possessed it. As a child I loved to sit on his knee and clasp his great hand with
                one of mine, while Miss Sullivan spelled into the other his beautiful words about God and the
                spiritual world. I heard him with a child's wonder and delight. My spirit could not reach up to
                his, but he gave me a real sense of joy in life, and I never left him without carrying away a
                fine thought that grew in beauty and depth of meaning as I grew. Once, when I was puzzled to
                know why there were so many religions, he said: "There is one universal religion, Helen—the
                religion of love. Love your Heavenly Father with your whole heart and soul, love every child
                of God as much as ever you can, and remember that the possibilities of good are greater than
                the possibilities of evil; and you have the key to Heaven." And his life was a happy illustration
                of this great truth. In his noble soul love and widest knowledge were blended with faith that
                had become insight</div>
